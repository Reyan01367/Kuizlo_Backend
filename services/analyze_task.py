    task_prompt = f"""
    You are an expert task analyzer and strategist. Analyze the provided content in detail and identify all possible tasks. Be flexible and dynamic enough to handle diverse data structures or contexts.

    **Context to consider:**
    1. The file may contain structured data (tables, forms) or unstructured text (paragraphs, images, or lists).
    2. Explicit and implicit tasks should be included, covering questions, calculations, summaries, or suggested next steps.
    3. Original data formats may require specific outputs or transformations (e.g., HTML, JSON, Excel reports).

    **Output JSON Schema:**
    {{
        "tasks": [
            {{
                "task_id": "t1",
                "description": "Clear task description summarizing purpose and action",
                "type": "question|calculation|summary|transformation|etc",
                "priority": "high|medium|low",
                "dependencies": ["list other tasks it depends on, if any"]
            }}
        ]
    }}

    **Guidelines for Task Generation:**
    1. If the content has questions or requests, create tasks to answer them.
    2. For structured data, infer any logical groupings, patterns, or summaries required.
    3. Recognize themes and terms suggesting implicit tasks or areas requiring analysis.
    4. Each task should align with generating meaningful output for end users.
    5. If multiple outputs (e.g., charts, dashboards) are possible, include suggestions.

    Analyze the content here:
    {content[:3000]}

    Return the JSON output strictly matching the schema.

    You are an expert content analyzer and HTML generator. Your goal is to create structured and accurate HTML output based on identified tasks. 

    **Context:**
    1. Tasks are extracted from the provided content. Use the extracted tasks and the content itself to generate answers.
    2. If the task involves a question explicitly stated in the content, provide a direct answer using the context.
    3. For tasks that require logical interpretation, generate answers intelligently based on content themes.
    4. Ensure all information in the HTML is factually accurate and corresponds to the original context.

    **HTML Requirements:**
    1. Create a separate section for each task inside a `<div>` with a `class='task'` and a `data-task-id` attribute matching the task ID.
    2. Preserve the numbering and order of tasks as provided in the task list.
    3. For each task:
        - Include the task description as a heading.
        - Provide an answer or output for the task.
        - Clearly indicate if the answer is derived from the context or generated by AI.
    4. Format the HTML to be simple and readable. Use semantic tags where appropriate.

    **Example HTML for a task:**
    ```
    <div class='task' data-task-id='t1'>
        <h2>Task 1: Analyze the content for key themes</h2>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The content mentions key themes like...</p>

    You are an expert in identifying missing details and generating clarifying questions to complete tasks effectively. 

    **Objective:**

    - As the last question, ask if the user wants to add any additional tasks or inputs.

    1. Only ask for information that is missing or unclear, based on the tasks and context.
    2. Do not repeat or reframe questions explicitly present in the tasks.
    3. Where applicable, provide multiple-choice options to make responses easier.
