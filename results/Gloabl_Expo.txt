These exhibitions not only highlight technological advancements but also emphasize social challenges, such as gender equality and health-related issues, which necessitate global attention. For instance, the ongoing discussions surrounding Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) underscore a significant social issue that requires international cooperation and understanding. Maryam En-Nosse and Jürgen Wacker (2024) highlight how global platforms can serve as catalysts for social change, using the example of FGM awareness campaigns that have gained traction in various expos. By bringing together diverse stakeholders, including governments, NGOs, and local communities, Global Expos create an environment conducive to sharing best practices and developing strategies to combat such issues worldwide. This collaboration is essential for creating a global consciousness around gender-based practices, ultimately contributing to the eradication of harmful traditions. In addition to social issues, Global Expos focus on education and workforce readiness, particularly in the context of rapid technological advancement. As highlighted by Kek et al. (2022), the future-ready education model emphasizes the importance of preparing students for a world that is increasingly influenced by technology and globalization. At these expos, countries can showcase their educational innovations and programs aimed at equipping students with essential skills for the future. For instance, interactive exhibits that incorporate virtual reality or artificial intelligence can provide insights into how education systems around the world are adapting to meet the demands of future economies. Such showcases not only inspire other nations to adopt similar methods but also encourage partnerships that enhance educational opportunities across borders. The collaborative nature of Global Expos allows for the sharing of resources, methodologies, and success stories that can significantly improve educational practices globally. Furthermore, the significance of innovation in transportation technology is a recurring theme at Global Expos, reflecting the critical role of effective mobility solutions in a rapidly evolving world. For example, the work by Lu Fan et al. (2021) on flight dynamics analysis for flying-wing configuration aircraft exemplifies the technological innovations that are often presented at these events. By featuring advancements in aviation, Global Expos highlight the importance of sustainable and efficient transportation systems in addressing climate change and enhancing global connectivity. Attendees have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge technologies and participate in discussions about the future of transport, including the potential for electric and autonomous vehicles. This focus on innovation not only captivates the audience but also encourages nations to invest in research and development that can lead to more sustainable practices in transportation, ultimately benefiting the global community. Moreover, the economic impact of Global Expos cannot be overstated, as they create opportunities for trade and investment that can significantly benefit participating nations. The expos serve as a meeting point for businesses, entrepreneurs, and government representatives to forge partnerships and explore new markets. By showcasing local products and innovations, countries can attract foreign investment and stimulate their economies. The World Expo in Dubai, for example, has been pivotal in promoting economic diversification in the region, providing a platform for businesses to network and collaborate on projects that drive growth. Such economic opportunities are particularly vital for developing nations, which can leverage their participation in Global Expos to gain visibility and access to international markets, ultimately enhancing their economic resilience and sustainability. In addition to promoting economic growth and educational advancement, Global Expos also play a critical role in addressing environmental challenges. With climate change being one of the most pressing issues of our time, expos provide a unique platform for nations to share their sustainability initiatives and environmental technologies. The integration of environmental themes into expo presentations encourages participants to engage in discussions about best practices for sustainability and the importance of collective action. For instance, countries can showcase innovations in renewable energy, waste reduction, and sustainable agriculture, allowing for knowledge exchange that can accelerate the implementation of green technologies across borders. The collaborative atmosphere of the expo enables participants to explore how they can work together to mitigate environmental challenges, fostering a sense of global responsibility and shared commitment to protecting the planet. In conclusion, Global Expos serve as a multifaceted platform that brings together diverse stakeholders to address critical global issues, promote innovation, and foster economic growth. By highlighting social challenges such as FGM, emphasizing the importance of future-ready education, showcasing advancements in transportation technology, and addressing environmental concerns, these events play a crucial role in shaping a more interconnected and sustainable world. The collaborative nature of Global Expos not only enhances the exchange of ideas and practices but also inspires collective action towards shared goals.<br><br><h3>Conclusion</h3><br><br>In conclusion, Global Expo serves as a vital platform for the dissemination of knowledge and collaboration across various fields. The work of Maryam En-Nosse and Jürgen Wacker in "Female Genital Mutilation" (2024) sheds light on critical human rights issues, emphasizing the need for awareness and action.
