Forget a sugar or salt tax! A 25% subsidy on fruit and vegetables would rescue the UK's waistline and stop people turning to cheaper junk food, study finds.

### Article Published
Date: 30 March 2022

### Introduction
The UK faces a significant public health crisis due to obesity, exacerbated by the high cost of fresh fruits and vegetables. The article discusses a proposed 25% subsidy on these items to make healthier food options more affordable, thereby addressing negative externalities associated with obesity. This policy aims to correct market failures by increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables, which currently suffer from under-consumption due to their high prices.

### Diagram Explanation
The diagram illustrates the market for fruits and vegetables in the UK. Without subsidies, the market equilibrium occurs at a lower quantity (Q1) and higher price (P1) than is socially optimal. This under-consumption leads to negative externalities, such as increased healthcare costs. The proposed subsidy shifts the supply curve downward from S1 to S2, reducing the price for consumers to P2 and increasing the quantity consumed to Q2, aligning with the socially optimal level.

### Analysis
The article highlights the market failure in the fruit and vegetable market, where high prices lead to under-consumption, exacerbating obesity-related health issues. The proposed 25% subsidy reduces the effective price, increasing affordability and consumption. This policy addresses the positive externalities associated with higher fruit and vegetable intake, such as improved public health and reduced healthcare costs. The price elasticity of demand for these products is relatively elastic, meaning that a reduction in price leads to a proportionally larger increase in quantity demanded. This elasticity amplifies the subsidy’s impact, making it an effective tool for increasing consumption and addressing market failures.

### Evaluation
#### Long-term vs. Short-term Effects
In the short term, the subsidy effectively reduces prices and increases consumption, addressing under-consumption and improving public health. However, the long-term sustainability of this policy depends on government funding. A £2.5 billion annual subsidy represents a significant fiscal commitment, which may be challenging to maintain, especially during economic downturns.

#### Assumptions
The policy assumes that lower prices will lead to healthier eating habits. However, other factors, such as consumer preferences and availability, may limit the policy’s effectiveness. Additionally, the assumption that consumers will allocate savings from reduced prices to purchasing more fruits and vegetables may not hold if they choose to spend on other goods.

#### Stakeholders
- **Consumers**: Benefit from lower prices and improved access to healthier foods.
- **Producers**: May experience increased demand, leading to higher revenues.
- **Government**: Faces a significant financial burden due to the subsidy cost but benefits from reduced long-term healthcare expenses.
- **Society**: Gains from improved public health and reduced obesity-related externalities.

#### Prioritization
Compared to alternative policies like sugar taxes or advertising restrictions, subsidies are less intrusive and directly address affordability. However, complementary measures, such as public awareness campaigns, may enhance the subsidy’s effectiveness by encouraging healthier eating habits.

#### Practicality
Implementing the subsidy is straightforward, as it involves direct financial transfers to producers or retailers. However, ensuring that savings are passed on to consumers requires effective monitoring and regulation.

### Conclusions
The proposed 25% subsidy on fruits and vegetables addresses significant market failures by reducing prices and increasing consumption, thereby mitigating obesity-related externalities. While effective in the short term, the policy’s long-term success depends on sustained government funding and complementary measures to influence consumer behavior. Despite these challenges, the subsidy offers a market-based solution with substantial public health benefits, aligning with the UK’s broader efforts to combat obesity.
